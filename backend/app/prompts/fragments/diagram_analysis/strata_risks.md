### Strata and Body Corporate Risk Assessment Framework

**Critical Strata Risks:**
- **Disputed Unit Boundaries**: Unclear or contested boundaries between lots and common property
- **Defective Common Property**: Major structural or building defects in shared areas requiring expensive repairs
- **Excessive Body Corporate Levies**: Unsustainably high ongoing fees or large special assessments
- **Management Disputes**: Serious conflicts within body corporate affecting property management
- **Exclusive Use Area Conflicts**: Disputes over allocated exclusive use areas like balconies or parking

**High Risk Strata Issues:**
- **Building Defects**: Structural issues affecting multiple units requiring collective remediation
- **Insurance Inadequacy**: Insufficient building insurance coverage for replacement value
- **Sinking Fund Deficiency**: Inadequate reserves for major maintenance and capital works
- **By-law Restrictions**: Restrictive by-laws significantly limiting property use or modification
- **Developer Control Issues**: Ongoing developer involvement creating management conflicts

**Medium Risk Strata Considerations:**
- **Moderate Levy Increases**: Body corporate fees trending upward but within reasonable ranges
- **Aging Building Infrastructure**: Older buildings approaching major maintenance cycles
- **Parking and Storage Disputes**: Minor conflicts over parking allocation or storage use
- **Pet and Noise Restrictions**: By-law limitations on pets, noise, or lifestyle factors
- **Rental Restrictions**: Limitations on leasing or short-term rental arrangements

**Strata Assessment Criteria:**
- **Unit Entitlements**: Fair allocation of unit entitlements relative to lot size and value
- **Common Property Quality**: Condition and maintenance standards of shared facilities
- **Financial Health**: Body corporate reserves, budget management, and fee sustainability
- **Governance Quality**: Effectiveness of committee management and decision-making processes
- **Legal Compliance**: Adherence to strata legislation and regulatory requirements

**Body Corporate Financial Risk Factors:**
- **Levy Affordability**: Ongoing body corporate fees as percentage of property value and income
- **Special Assessment Risk**: Potential for unexpected large assessments for repairs or improvements
- **Insurance Premium Increases**: Rising building insurance costs affecting levy sustainability
- **Utility Cost Sharing**: Fair allocation of utility costs between lots and common areas
- **Professional Management Fees**: Costs for strata management and professional services

**Common Property Risk Assessment:**
- **Structural Integrity**: Building structure, roof, and weatherproofing condition
- **Mechanical Systems**: Lifts, fire safety, electrical, and plumbing system condition
- **Recreational Facilities**: Pool, gym, and other facility maintenance and liability
- **Security Systems**: Building security and access control system adequacy
- **Landscaping and Gardens**: Common area maintenance requirements and costs

**Professional Consultation Requirements:**
- **Strata Lawyer**: By-law interpretation, dispute resolution, compliance issues
- **Building Inspector**: Common property defect identification and assessment
- **Strata Manager**: Financial review, governance assessment, management advice
- **Accountant**: Financial analysis of body corporate accounts and budgets
