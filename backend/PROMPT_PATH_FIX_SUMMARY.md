# Prompt Path Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The error logs showed that the system was looking for the `australian_legal.md` file at the wrong path:

**Error Path**: `/Users/bohuihan/ai/real2ai/backend/app/prompts/user/system/context/australian_legal.md`

**Correct Path**: `/Users/bohuihan/ai/real2ai/backend/app/prompts/system/context/australian_legal.md`

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `get_prompt_manager()` function in `backend/app/core/prompts/manager.py`. The path construction was incorrect:

```python
# INCORRECT (before fix)
prompts_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "prompts"

# CORRECT (after fix)  
prompts_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent / "prompts"
```

### Path Resolution Breakdown

- **File Location**: `backend/app/core/prompts/manager.py`
- **Incorrect Path**: `.parent.parent.parent` = `backend/app/core/` + `prompts` = `backend/app/core/prompts`
- **Correct Path**: `.parent.parent.parent.parent` = `backend/app/` + `prompts` = `backend/app/prompts`

## Files Fixed

The same incorrect path construction pattern was found in multiple files and has been corrected:

1. **`backend/app/core/prompts/manager.py`** - Main PromptManager initialization
2. **`backend/app/core/prompts/simple_test.py`** - Test configuration
3. **`backend/app/core/prompts/examples/usage_examples.py`** - Example configurations
4. **`backend/app/core/prompts/test_fragment_system.py`** - Fragment system tests

## Impact

This fix resolves the `PromptNotFoundError: Prompt file not found: australian_legal.md` error that was preventing:

- Contract terms extraction from working
- Prompt composition system from functioning
- System prompts from being loaded correctly

## Verification

The fix has been verified using a test script that confirms:

✅ Prompts directory is correctly located at `/Users/bohuihan/ai/real2ai/backend/app/prompts`  
✅ `australian_legal.md` file is found at the correct path  
✅ Configuration files are accessible  
✅ System directories are properly structured  

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Use absolute paths** when possible instead of relative path construction
2. **Add path validation** in the PromptManager initialization
3. **Create unit tests** that verify path resolution works correctly
4. **Document the expected directory structure** clearly

## Status

**RESOLVED** - The prompt path issue has been fixed and verified. The system should now be able to load the `australian_legal` system prompt correctly.
