### Boundary and Easement Risk Assessment Framework

**Critical Boundary Risks:**
- **Major Encroachments**: Structures significantly crossing property boundaries requiring legal resolution
- **Disputed Boundary Lines**: Active disputes or unclear boundary demarcations affecting title
- **Missing Legal Access**: No legal right of way to public roads or essential services
- **Easement Violations**: Existing structures or improvements blocking required easement access
- **Survey Discrepancies**: Major differences between title plans and actual property boundaries

**High Risk Boundary Issues:**
- **Minor Encroachments**: Small structural overlaps requiring negotiation or legal clarification
- **Restrictive Easements**: Easements significantly limiting building envelope or property use
- **Shared Access Disputes**: Complex shared driveway or access arrangements with ongoing conflicts
- **Setback Violations**: Buildings or structures not meeting required boundary setbacks
- **Easement Maintenance Issues**: Unclear maintenance responsibilities for easement areas

**Medium Risk Boundary Considerations:**
- **Fence Line Discrepancies**: Fences not aligned with actual property boundaries
- **Easement Impact on Development**: Easements reducing available building area but not preventing development
- **Shared Infrastructure Boundaries**: Complex arrangements for shared walls, driveways, or utilities
- **Future Access Changes**: Potential changes to access arrangements or easement requirements
- **Survey Age and Accuracy**: Older surveys requiring verification for development purposes

**Boundary Assessment Criteria:**
- **Legal Clarity**: Clear definition of boundary lines and property limits in title documents
- **Physical Demarcation**: Visible boundary markers, fences, or natural features defining property
- **Easement Impact**: Effect of easements on building envelope and property development potential
- **Access Adequacy**: Sufficient legal and physical access for intended property use
- **Resolution Complexity**: Difficulty and cost of resolving identified boundary issues
- **Development Implications**: Impact on future property improvements and building plans

**Easement-Specific Risk Factors:**
- **Width and Location**: Easement size and placement affecting property use and development
- **Purpose and Usage**: Type of easement (drainage, utility, access) and intensity of use
- **Maintenance Obligations**: Responsibility for easement area upkeep and repair costs
- **Future Modifications**: Potential for easement changes or additional easement creation
- **Beneficiary Rights**: Third-party rights and obligations affecting property ownership

**Professional Consultation Requirements:**
- **Licensed Surveyor**: Boundary verification, survey updates, easement documentation
- **Property Lawyer**: Legal rights analysis, easement interpretation, dispute resolution
- **Planning Consultant**: Development impact assessment, setback compliance verification
- **Structural Engineer**: Building design around easements and boundary constraints
