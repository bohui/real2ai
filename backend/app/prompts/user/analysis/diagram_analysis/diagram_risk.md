# Comprehensive Diagram Risk Assessment - {{ australian_state | default("Australian") }} Property

You are an expert property risk analyst specializing in Australian real estate transactions. Transform the provided diagram semantics into a comprehensive risk assessment that identifies potential issues across all critical categories affecting property ownership, development, and compliance.

## Analysis Context
- **State**: {{ australian_state | default("Australia") }}
- **Contract Type**: {{ contract_type | default("purchase_agreement") }}
- **User Experience**: {{ user_experience | default("novice") }}
{% if property_type %}
- **Property Type**: {{ property_type }}
{% endif %}
{% if use_category %}
- **Use Category**: {{ use_category }}
{% endif %}
{% if purchase_method %}
- **Purchase Method**: {{ purchase_method }}
{% endif %}
{% if analysis_focus %}
- **Analysis Focus**: {{ analysis_focus }}
{% endif %}
{% if address %}
- **Property Address**: {{ address }}
{% endif %}

## Input Data
- **Diagram Types**: {{ diagram_types | tojson }}

## Source Semantics Analysis
Transform this diagram semantics output into structured risk assessment:

{{ image_semantics_result | tojsonpretty }}

## Risk Assessment Framework

The following specialized risk assessment frameworks will be automatically included based on your specific context (contract type, diagram types, use category, etc.):

{{ diagram_analysis_fragments }}

{{ state_requirements_fragments }}

{{ user_experience_fragments }}

{{ analysis_depth_fragments }}

**Note**: Only relevant risk frameworks are included based on your contract type, diagram types, and property use category. For example, development risks are only included for purchase agreements, while lease-specific operational risks are only included for lease agreements.

{% if address %}
**Web Search Enhancement**: You have access to web search tools. Use the provided property address to search for current information about:
- Local planning overlays and zoning changes
- Recent flood or bushfire events in the area
- Current market conditions and development activity
- Council notices or infrastructure projects
- Environmental hazards or contamination reports
- Local building restrictions or heritage listings

Only search when specific local context would significantly enhance the risk assessment.
{% endif %}

## {{ australian_state | default("Australian") }} Specific Risk Considerations

{% if australian_state == "NSW" %}
### NSW Specific Risk Factors
- **BASIX Compliance**: Energy/water efficiency requirements for alterations
- **Section 149 Certificate Issues**: Planning restrictions, environmental hazards
- **Acid Sulfate Soil Risks**: Disturbance requirements, management obligations
- **Coastal Hazard Risks**: Erosion, sea level rise, development restrictions
- **Heritage Conservation Areas**: Development limitations, approval complexities
{% elif australian_state == "VIC" %}
### VIC Specific Risk Factors
- **ResCode Compliance**: Design standards, setback requirements, building envelope
- **Planning Scheme Overlays**: Environmental, heritage, development overlays
- **Native Vegetation Removal**: Permit requirements, offset obligations
- **Bushfire Management Overlays**: Construction standards, defendable space
- **Sustainable Design Requirements**: Energy efficiency, orientation constraints
{% elif australian_state == "QLD" %}
### QLD Specific Risk Factors
- **State Planning Policy Compliance**: Koala habitat, wetlands, natural hazards
- **Bushfire Hazard Areas**: Medium/high risk construction requirements
- **Flood Mapping Compliance**: Defined flood event restrictions
- **Koala Habitat Mapping**: Development restrictions, offset requirements
- **Coastal Management Plans**: Erosion, storm tide, development controls
{% endif %}

## Risk Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)
- Issues preventing property use or development
- Safety hazards requiring immediate attention
- Legal compliance violations with enforcement risk
- Major infrastructure failures or inadequacies

### High Priority Risks (Professional Consultation Needed)
- Significant development constraints requiring expert assessment
- Complex approval processes with uncertain outcomes
- Major infrastructure modifications or upgrades needed
- Environmental hazards requiring specialist evaluation

### Medium Priority Risks (Investigation Required Before Settlement)
- Issues affecting property value or future development
- Moderate compliance concerns requiring attention
- Infrastructure limitations affecting normal use
- Boundary or access issues requiring clarification

### Low Priority Risks (Standard Considerations)
- Normal property ownership considerations
- Standard maintenance and upkeep requirements
- Minor compliance issues easily addressed
- Typical development constraints for the area

## Output Requirements

Generate a comprehensive **DiagramRiskAssessment** JSON object including:

### 1. Property and Assessment Metadata
- Property identifier from semantics
- Assessment date and diagram sources analyzed
- Overall risk scoring and total risks identified

### 2. Categorized Risk Analysis
For each risk category, provide:
- **Risk Description**: Clear explanation of the identified risk
- **Severity Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low with justification
- **Linked Diagrams**: Reference to specific diagrams showing the risk using DiagramReference objects
- **Potential Impact**: Financial, legal, or practical implications
- **Evidence**: Specific elements from semantics supporting the risk identification

### 3. Diagram References
For each risk, create accurate **DiagramReference** objects:
- **diagram_type**: From the provided diagram_types array
- **diagram_name**: Descriptive name based on semantics image_title or diagram type
- **page_reference**: If available from semantics source_page_number
- **section_reference**: Specific area of diagram showing the risk
- **confidence_level**: Based on semantics analysis_confidence

### 4. Overall Assessment and Recommendations
- **overall_risk_score**: Calculated based on individual risk severities
- **high_priority_risks**: List of most critical risk descriptions
- **recommended_actions**: Specific actions to mitigate identified risks
- **legal_review_required**: Boolean indicating need for legal consultation
- **additional_investigations_needed**: List of recommended professional consultations

### 5. Professional Consultation Recommendations
Recommend appropriate professionals based on the specific risks identified, using the detailed consultation guidance provided in the contextual fragments above.

## Analysis Standards

### Evidence-Based Assessment
- Every risk must be supported by specific evidence from the semantics
- Cite specific elements, measurements, or findings that support each risk
- Distinguish between observed facts and inferred implications

### Australian Property Context
- Apply state-specific regulations and requirements where applicable
- Consider local planning schemes and development controls
- Reference relevant Australian standards and building codes

### User Experience Adaptation
{% if user_experience == "novice" %}
- Provide clear explanations of technical terms and implications
- Focus on practical impacts rather than technical details
- Emphasize need for professional consultation on complex issues
{% elif user_experience == "experienced" %}
- Include technical details and regulatory references
- Focus on specific compliance requirements and approval processes
- Provide detailed cost and timeline implications
{% else %}
- Balance technical accuracy with practical accessibility
- Provide both immediate concerns and long-term considerations
{% endif %}

### Risk Communication Standards
- Use clear, non-technical language for risk descriptions
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Quantify impacts where possible (financial, timeline, compliance)
- Prioritize risks based on potential consequences and likelihood

**Return only the structured JSON object following the DiagramRiskAssessment schema. Do not include explanatory text or commentary outside the JSON structure.**
