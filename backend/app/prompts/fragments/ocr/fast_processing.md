### Fast Processing Requirements:

**Speed-Optimized Settings:**
- Use rapid OCR processing with acceptable accuracy trade-offs
- Minimal image preprocessing for faster throughput
- Single-pass extraction with basic validation
- Focus on essential information extraction only
- Prioritize speed over perfect accuracy

**Essential Information Focus:**
- Extract key amounts and dates quickly
- Capture party names and basic details
- Identify document type and main sections
- Skip detailed formatting preservation
- Flag only critical extraction failures

**Efficiency Measures:**
- Use fast document recognition patterns
- Apply streamlined validation rules
- Report basic extraction metrics only
- Optimize for time-sensitive decisions
