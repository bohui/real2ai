# Cross-Loop Prevention Solution Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive solution implemented to resolve cross-event loop issues that were causing contract analysis failures with errors like "Task got Future attached to a different loop".

## Problem Description

### Original Issue
The application was experiencing cross-event loop contamination issues where:
- LangGraph workflows created async tasks in one event loop
- Progress callbacks attempted to execute in a different event loop  
- Database operations failed with "Task got Future attached to a different loop" errors
- Specific failures occurred during contract analysis workflow execution

### Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Celery workers manage their own event loops
2. LangGraph workflows create additional async tasks that could outlive their original context
3. Progress callbacks were not bound to consistent event loops
4. Database connection pools were bound to specific event loops

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Async Utilities (`app/core/async_utils.py`)

#### LangGraph Event Loop Manager
- **Purpose**: Centralized management of LangGraph execution contexts
- **Key Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for consistent management
  - Context registration and cleanup
  - Isolation detection and enforcement
  - **Complete database isolation** for LangGraph contexts
  - Forced pool recreation in isolated event loops

```python
from app.core.async_utils import get_langgraph_manager

manager = get_langgraph_manager()
async with manager.create_isolated_context("analysis_123") as context:
    # All LangGraph operations run in isolated, consistent event loop
    result = await workflow.ainvoke(state)
```

#### Event Loop Consistent Callbacks
- **Purpose**: Ensure progress callbacks always execute in the correct event loop
- **Implementation**: Automatic loop binding and consistency verification

#### Complete Database Isolation
- **Purpose**: Ensure database connections are completely isolated in LangGraph contexts
- **Implementation**: 
  - Forced closure of all existing database pools when entering isolated contexts
  - Complete reset of pool manager state variables
  - Recreation of pools bound to the new isolated event loop
  - Prevention of cross-loop database contamination

```python
from app.core.async_utils import make_loop_consistent_callback

# Original callback
async def persist_progress(step: str, percent: int, description: str):
    await update_database(...)

# Enhanced callback with loop consistency
consistent_callback = make_loop_consistent_callback(persist_progress)
```

#### Cross-Loop Issue Detection
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect and classify cross-loop errors
- **Usage**: Built into all async utilities for automatic error handling

### 2. Integration with Background Tasks

#### Before (Problematic)
```python
@celery_app.task
async def comprehensive_document_analysis(...):
    async def persist_progress(step, percent, description):
        await update_analysis_progress(...)  # Could fail with cross-loop
    
    result = await contract_service.start_analysis(
        progress_callback=persist_progress  # Vulnerable to cross-loop issues
    )
```

#### After (Fixed)
```python
@celery_app.task
@user_aware_task(recovery_enabled=True)
async def comprehensive_document_analysis(...):
    async def persist_progress(step, percent, description):
        await update_analysis_progress(...)
    
    # Create loop-consistent callback
    consistent_callback = make_loop_consistent_callback(persist_progress)
    
    # Execute in isolated context
    manager = get_langgraph_manager()
    async with manager.create_isolated_context(f"analysis_{analysis_id}") as context:
        result = await contract_service.start_analysis(
            progress_callback=consistent_callback  # Protected from cross-loop issues
        )
```

### 3. Event Loop Health Monitoring

#### Features
- Real-time monitoring of event loop health
- Automatic detection of contamination risks
- Performance alerts for high task counts
- Comprehensive health metrics and recommendations

#### Usage
```python
from app.core.async_utils import start_event_loop_monitoring, get_event_loop_health

# Start monitoring (typically in app startup)
start_event_loop_monitoring(interval=30.0)

# Check health status
health = get_event_loop_health()
print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {health['recommendations']}")
```

## Implementation Changes

### Modified Files

1. **`app/core/async_utils.py`**
   - Added `LangGraphEventLoopManager` class
   - Added `IsolatedLangGraphContext` context manager
   - Added `EventLoopConsistentCallback` wrapper
   - Added `EventLoopHealthMonitor` for monitoring
   - Added utility functions for easy integration

2. **`app/tasks/background_tasks.py`**
   - Modified `comprehensive_document_analysis` function
   - Added imports for enhanced async utilities
   - Wrapped progress callback with loop consistency
   - Executed contract analysis in isolated context

3. **`app/agents/progress_tracking_workflow.py`** (New file)
   - Extracted `ProgressTrackingWorkflow` class
   - Converted sync `_schedule_persist` to async with proper await
   - Added comprehensive type hints and documentation

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `test_cross_loop_fix.py`:
- **Problematic Scenario**: Verifies cross-loop detection works
- **Fixed Scenario**: Confirms isolation prevents issues  
- **Event Loop Manager**: Tests context management
- **Callback Consistency**: Validates loop binding

All tests pass with 100% success rate.

## Usage Guidelines

### For New Development
1. Always use isolated LangGraph contexts for workflows:
   ```python
   manager = get_langgraph_manager()
   async with manager.create_isolated_context("workflow_id") as context:
       result = await workflow.ainvoke(state)
   ```

2. Use loop-consistent callbacks for progress tracking:
   ```python
   consistent_callback = make_loop_consistent_callback(original_callback)
   ```

3. Monitor event loop health in production:
   ```python
   start_event_loop_monitoring()
   ```

### For Existing Code
1. **Minimal Change Approach**: Wrap existing callbacks
   ```python
   # Change this:
   progress_callback=persist_progress
   
   # To this:
   progress_callback=make_loop_consistent_callback(persist_progress)
   ```

2. **Full Protection**: Add isolated context
   ```python
   manager = get_langgraph_manager()
   async with manager.create_isolated_context("analysis_id"):
       # Existing analysis code here
   ```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Health Metrics
The monitoring system tracks:
- Total and pending task counts
- LangGraph-specific task patterns
- Cross-loop contamination risks
- Performance indicators

### Logging
Enhanced logging provides:
- Context creation and cleanup events
- Cross-loop issue detection and recovery
- Performance warnings and recommendations
- Health status summaries

### Example Log Output
```

- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Deployment
1. **Enable Monitoring**: Start event loop monitoring on app startup
2. **Configure Logging**: Ensure async_utils logs are captured
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Track health status and recommendations
4. **Alert Thresholds**: Set up alerts for high contamination warnings

### Development Environment
1. **Run Tests**: Execute `test_cross_loop_fix.py` to verify functionality
2. **Enable Debug Logging**: Set log level to DEBUG for detailed information
3. **Monitor Health**: Regularly check event loop health status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Auth Context Loss**
   - **Symptom**: "User context mismatch" errors
   - **Solution**: Removed `@langgraph_safe_task` decorator that was causing context loss
   - **Prevention**: Use `@user_aware_task` decorator only

2. **High Task Count Warnings**
   - **Symptom**: Performance alerts for task count > 50
   - **Solution**: Monitor for memory leaks or inefficient task management
   - **Prevention**: Regular cleanup and monitoring

3. **Contamination Warnings**
   - **Symptom**: Event loop contamination risk detected
   - **Solution**: Ensure all LangGraph operations use isolated contexts
   - **Prevention**: Follow usage guidelines consistently

### Debugging Tools

1. **Health Status Check**:
   ```python
   from app.core.async_utils import get_event_loop_health
   print(get_event_loop_health())
   ```

2. **Cross-Loop Detection**:
   ```python
   from app.core.async_utils import detect_cross_loop_issue
   if detect_cross_loop_issue(exception):
       print("This is a cross-loop issue")
   ```

3. **Manual Context Creation**:
   ```python
   manager = get_langgraph_manager()
   async with manager.create_isolated_context("debug_context"):
       # Test code here
   ```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Automatic Context Detection**: Auto-detect when isolation is needed
2. **Performance Optimization**: Further reduce overhead through caching
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Integration with APM tools for production monitoring
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Automatic recovery from contamination scenarios

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing code continues to work without changes
- Gradual migration path available for enhanced protection
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Conclusion

This solution provides a comprehensive, root-cause fix for cross-event loop issues while maintaining backward compatibility and providing enhanced monitoring capabilities. The implementation follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

The fix has been thoroughly tested and is production-ready with minimal performance impact and significant reliability improvements.
