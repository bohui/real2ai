### Victoria Section 32 Vendor Statements

**Critical VIC Requirement**: A Section 32 vendor statement must be provided to the purchaser before the contract is signed, per Sale of Land Act 1962 (Vic) s 32 and the Sale of Land Regulations. Failure to provide an accurate and complete statement can render the contract voidable by the purchaser.

**Key information to verify (prescribed matters):**
- **Title particulars**: Certificate of Title details, plan of subdivision, and any registered encumbrances (mortgages, easements, covenants, caveats)
- **Outgoings**: Rates, taxes and other charges affecting the land (current and outstanding amounts)
- **Planning information**: Planning scheme and zoning, applicable overlays (e.g., HO, BMO, LSIO, SBO, EAO), and any planning permits/conditions
- **Building permits (last 7 years)**: Details of building permits issued; owner‑builder works and required insurance/warranty if applicable
- **Owners corporation (if applicable)**: An Owners Corporation Certificate (Owners Corporations Act 2006 (Vic) s 151) and required attachments (fees, special levies, insurance, rules, minutes)
- **Services**: Whether services (water, sewerage, electricity, gas, telecommunications) are connected or not available
- **Notices and orders**: Any notices, orders or approved proposals by authorities affecting the land or requiring work
- **Road access**: Adequate access to the property by road
- **Agreements affecting the land**: e.g., Section 173 Agreements (Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Vic))
- **Tax/levy regimes potentially applicable**: Growth Areas Infrastructure Contribution (GAIC) in growth areas; Windfall Gains Tax (WGT) exposure arising from rezoning

**Mandatory disclosures and typical attachments**:
- Current title search and plan of subdivision
- Owners Corporation Certificate with prescribed attachments (if applicable)
- Schedule of outgoings and any special levies (if applicable)
- Details of building permits issued in the last 7 years; owner‑builder warranty insurance (if relevant)
- Copies or particulars of any notices, orders, proposals by authorities
- Disclosure of encumbrances: mortgages, easements, covenants, caveats and other interests

**Red flags to watch for**:
- ⚠️ **Incomplete statement**: Missing prescribed matters or required OC certificate/attachments
- ⚠️ **Unapproved works**: Owner‑builder or other works without permits or required warranty insurance
- ⚠️ **Overlays/constraints**: Heritage, bushfire, flood/inundation, environmental audit overlays limiting use/development
- ⚠️ **Outstanding OC levies**: Unpaid fees or flagged special levies
- ⚠️ **Section 173 Agreements**: Restrictive conditions on use/development

**Compliance notes**:
- Statement must be current, complete and signed at the time of contract; update if material facts change
- Cooling‑off rights for private sales are governed by Sale of Land Act 1962 (Vic) s 31 (3 clear business days; auction and other exceptions apply)
- Additional reports (building/pest, engineering, surveys) are not substitutes for statutory disclosures and should be separately reviewed
