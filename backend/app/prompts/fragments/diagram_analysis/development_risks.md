### Development and Zoning Risk Assessment Framework

**Critical Development Risks:**
- **Zoning Non-Compliance**: Current or proposed use inconsistent with zoning regulations
- **Heritage Protection Orders**: Strict heritage controls preventing or severely limiting development
- **Building Height Violations**: Existing structures exceeding maximum height limits
- **Inadequate Building Envelope**: Severely restricted buildable area limiting development potential
- **Environmental Overlay Prohibitions**: Environmental protections preventing development

**High Risk Development Issues:**
- **Complex Approval Processes**: Multiple overlays or controls requiring lengthy approval procedures
- **Significant Setback Requirements**: Large setbacks substantially reducing building area
- **Infrastructure Contribution Requirements**: Mandatory infrastructure payments for development approval
- **Aboriginal Heritage Sites**: Cultural heritage protections affecting development approval
- **Coastal or Waterway Setbacks**: Environmental setbacks from water features limiting development

**Medium Risk Development Considerations:**
- **Standard Planning Approvals**: Normal development application processes with typical approval conditions
- **Moderate Heritage Controls**: Heritage considerations requiring design sensitivity but not preventing development
- **Bushfire Construction Requirements**: Special building standards for bushfire-prone areas
- **Tree Preservation Requirements**: Significant vegetation requiring protection during development
- **Car Parking Requirements**: Planning requirements for on-site parking provision

**Development Assessment Criteria:**
- **Zoning Compliance**: Consistency with current zoning and permissible land uses
- **Overlay Impacts**: Effect of environmental, heritage, or other planning overlays
- **Approval Complexity**: Number of approval stages and consultation requirements
- **Design Constraints**: Limitations on building design, materials, and appearance
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: Obligations for infrastructure provision or contributions
- **Timeline Implications**: Expected timeframes for development approval processes

**Zoning-Specific Risk Factors:**
- **Use Permissions**: Allowed land uses under current zoning provisions
- **Development Standards**: Height, setback, and site coverage requirements
- **Design Controls**: Architectural and landscaping requirements
- **Subdivision Potential**: Ability to subdivide property for multiple dwellings
- **Future Rezoning Risk**: Potential for unfavorable zoning changes

**Compliance Risk Categories:**
- **Building Code Compliance**: Structural, fire safety, and accessibility requirements
- **Planning Scheme Compliance**: Local planning policy and development standard compliance
- **Environmental Compliance**: Flora, fauna, and habitat protection requirements
- **Heritage Compliance**: Conservation and restoration requirements for heritage properties

**Professional Consultation Requirements:**
- **Planning Consultant**: Development feasibility assessment, approval strategy, overlay interpretation
- **Heritage Consultant**: Heritage impact assessment, conservation management planning
- **Architect**: Design compliance with planning and building requirements
- **Environmental Consultant**: Flora, fauna, and habitat assessment for development approval
