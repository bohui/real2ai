### Sewer Service Diagram Specific Risk Assessment

**Critical Sewer-Specific Risks:**
- **Sewer Main Under Building Footprint**: Major sewer infrastructure directly under proposed or existing buildings preventing construction or requiring costly relocation
- **Inadequate Access Easements**: Insufficient easement width for Council maintenance access requirements (typically 3m minimum)
- **Deep Sewer Connections**: Excessive depth requiring pump systems or special connection arrangements
- **Private vs Council Responsibility Boundaries**: Unclear ownership boundaries creating maintenance and liability disputes

**High Risk Sewer Infrastructure Issues:**
- **Building Envelope Restrictions**: Sewer easements significantly reducing available building area
- **Foundation Design Complications**: Sewer lines requiring special foundation design or construction methods
- **Connection Point Accessibility**: Difficult or expensive property connection locations
- **Pump Station Requirements**: Properties requiring pump systems for sewer connection

**Sewer-Specific Assessment Criteria:**
- **Pipe Diameter and Capacity**: 225mm+ mains create significant development constraints
- **Invert Levels**: Depth below surface affecting foundation and basement construction
- **Easement Width**: 3m minimum width required for maintenance access
- **Connection Authority**: Council vs private responsibility for connection and maintenance
- **Flow Direction**: Gravity vs pump requirements for property connection

**Professional Consultation for Sewer Issues:**
- **Civil Engineer**: Connection design, pump system requirements, invert level calculations
- **Council Liaison**: Easement requirements, connection approvals, maintenance obligations
- **Structural Engineer**: Foundation design around sewer infrastructure
- **Surveyor**: Easement boundary verification, connection point location
