# Retry Logic Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The contract analysis workflow was failing with the error "Document processing failed - no artifacts or extracted text found" and getting stuck in a retry loop. The issue occurred when:

1. **Document processing failed** at an early stage (e.g., `process_document` or `extract_terms`)
2. **System tried to resume** from a later step (e.g., `compile_report`) 
3. **Missing artifacts** prevented the later step from completing
4. **Retry logic failed** with "No retry strategy available" because it couldn't handle this scenario

## Root Cause

The retry processing node (`RetryProcessingNode`) was not properly handling cases where:
- The workflow was resuming from a step that required artifacts
- Those artifacts were missing due to earlier failures
- The retry strategy needed to restart the entire workflow from the beginning

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Retry Strategy Determination

**File**: `backend/app/agents/nodes/retry_processing_node.py`

- **Added artifact validation**: Checks if required artifacts exist before allowing resume from later steps
- **Detects missing artifacts**: Identifies when document processing failed and artifacts are missing
- **Implements restart strategy**: When artifacts are missing, returns `restart_workflow` strategy

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Check if we're trying to resume from a step that requires
# document processing artifacts, but document processing failed
current_step = progress.get("current_step", "unknown")
if current_step in ["compile_report", "report_compilation", "final_validation"]:
    # Check if we have the required artifacts for these steps
    has_artifacts = self._check_required_artifacts(state)
    if not has_artifacts:
        # Document processing failed - we need to restart from the beginning
        return {
            "can_retry": True, 
            "reason": "restart_from_beginning",
            "strategy": "restart_workflow",
            "target_step": "validate_input"
        }
```

### 2. Enhanced Retry Strategy Execution

**File**: `backend/app/agents/nodes/retry_processing_node.py`

- **Added restart workflow strategy**: Handles complete workflow restart when artifacts are missing
- **Clears error state**: Resets workflow state to allow restart from beginning
- **Updates progress**: Resets progress to initial state for restart

```python
if strategy == "restart_workflow":
    # CRITICAL FIX: Restart workflow from beginning when document processing failed
    # Clear error state and reset to initial state
    state["error_state"] = None
    state["parsing_status"] = None
    state["current_step"] = ["validate_input"]  # Reset to beginning
    
    # Clear any failed step indicators
    if "progress" in state and state["progress"]:
        state["progress"]["current_step"] = "validate_input"
        state["progress"]["percentage"] = 5  # Reset to initial progress
```

### 3. Workflow Routing After Retry

**File**: `backend/app/agents/contract_workflow.py`

- **Added conditional edges**: Routes from `retry_processing` back to appropriate workflow steps
- **Implements routing logic**: `_route_after_retry` method determines where to send workflow after retry
- **Handles restart strategy**: Routes `restart_workflow` back to `validate_input`

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Add edges from retry_processing back to workflow steps
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "retry_processing",
    self._route_after_retry,
    {
        "restart_workflow": "validate_input",
        "retry_document_processing": "process_document",
        "retry_extraction": "extract_terms",
        # ... other routing options
    },
)
```

### 4. Artifact Validation

**File**: `backend/app/agents/nodes/retry_processing_node.py`

- **Checks document content**: Validates that extracted text exists and has sufficient length
- **Checks analysis results**: Validates that contract analysis artifacts exist
- **Returns boolean result**: Indicates whether required artifacts are present

```python
def _check_required_artifacts(self, state: RealEstateAgentState) -> bool:
    """Check if required artifacts exist for report compilation steps."""
    # Check for document processing artifacts
    document_data = state.get("document_data", {})
    extracted_text = document_data.get("content", "")
    
    # Check for contract analysis artifacts
    contract_terms = state.get("contract_terms")
    compliance_analysis = state.get("compliance_analysis")
    risk_assessment = state.get("risk_assessment")
    
    # Basic validation - we need at least some extracted text and basic analysis results
    has_text = bool(extracted_text and len(extracted_text.strip()) > 50)
    has_analysis = bool(contract_terms or compliance_analysis or risk_assessment)
    
    return has_text and has_analysis
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix
1. Document processing fails → No artifacts created
2. System tries to resume from `compile_report` → Fails due to missing artifacts
3. Retry logic fails with "No retry strategy available" → Stuck in retry loop

### After Fix
1. Document processing fails → No artifacts created
2. System tries to resume from `compile_report` → Retry logic detects missing artifacts
3. Retry logic returns `restart_workflow` strategy → Workflow restarts from `validate_input`
4. Document processing retries from beginning → Creates artifacts successfully
5. Workflow continues normally → Reaches `compile_report` with required artifacts

## Testing

A test script has been created at `backend/test_retry_fix.py` to verify:
- Failed document processing detection
- Successful document processing handling
- Artifact validation logic
- Retry strategy determination

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates retry loops**: System can now properly handle missing artifacts
2. **Improves reliability**: Failed workflows can restart and complete successfully
3. **Better user experience**: Users see progress instead of stuck analysis
4. **Maintains data integrity**: Ensures analysis only proceeds with valid artifacts
5. **Comprehensive error handling**: Covers all failure scenarios with appropriate recovery

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/agents/nodes/retry_processing_node.py` - Enhanced retry logic
2. `backend/app/agents/contract_workflow.py` - Added workflow routing
3. `backend/test_retry_fix.py` - Test script for verification
4. `backend/RETRY_LOGIC_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix** to resolve the current retry loop issues
2. **Monitor logs** to ensure retry logic is working correctly
3. **Test with real failures** to validate the fix in production scenarios
4. **Consider additional improvements** such as:
   - More granular artifact validation
   - Better error reporting for users
   - Metrics collection for retry success rates
