# Migration Schema Improvements

## Summary
Successfully consolidated redundant migration files into a streamlined initial schema with enhanced functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Merged Onboarding Tracking (20240101000005)
- âœ… Onboarding fields already existed in initial schema
- âœ… Removed redundant safety checks and duplicate migration
- âœ… Retained backward compatibility features

### 2. Enhanced Analysis Progress (20250105000000)
- âœ… Replaced basic progress table with comprehensive structure
- âœ… Added timing information (step_started_at, step_completed_at, total_elapsed_seconds)
- âœ… Enhanced progress tracking (progress_percent, step_description, estimated_completion_minutes)
- âœ… Added status management (in_progress, completed, failed, cancelled)
- âœ… Integrated functions for progress management:
  - `update_analysis_progress()` - Create/update progress records
  - `complete_analysis_progress()` - Mark analysis completion
  - `get_latest_analysis_progress()` - Retrieve latest progress
- âœ… Added analysis_progress_detailed view with contract/analysis joins
- âœ… Enhanced security policies for service role access

### 3. Database Structure Improvements
- **Enhanced Tables**: analysis_progress with comprehensive fields
- **New Functions**: Progress management with timing calculations
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes including partial index for active progress
- **Security**: Proper RLS policies for service role operations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive column comments for clarity

### 4. Cleanup Results
- **Before**: 7 migration files
- **After**: 5 migration files (removed 2 redundant files)
- **Benefit**: Simplified deployment, reduced migration complexity
