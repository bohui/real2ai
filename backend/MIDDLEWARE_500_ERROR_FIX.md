# Fix for 500 Error in Auth Middleware

## Problem

The authentication middleware was returning 500 internal server errors instead of proper 401 unauthorized responses when tokens were not found in Redis. This was happening because:

1. **Exception Handling Issue**: The middleware was raising `HTTPException` inside middleware, which FastAPI was catching and wrapping in `ExceptionGroup`
2. **500 vs 401**: FastAPI treats unhandled exceptions as 500 errors, even when the intent was to return 401
3. **Error Propagation**: Exceptions in middleware can cause the entire request to fail with 500 status

## Root Cause

The issue was in this code:

```python
# OLD CODE - This caused 500 errors
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
    detail="Session mapping unavailable. Please log in again.",
)
```

When raised inside middleware, FastAPI's error handling catches this and wraps it in an `ExceptionGroup`, resulting in a 500 error instead of the intended 401.

## Solution

Replace exception raising with proper HTTP response returns:

```python
# NEW CODE - This returns proper 401 responses
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
return JSONResponse(
    status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
    content={"detail": "Session mapping unavailable. Please log in again."}
)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Token Exchange Error Response

**File**: `backend/app/middleware/auth_middleware.py`
**Location**: Around line 103

- **Before**: Raised `HTTPException` causing 500 errors
- **After**: Returns `JSONResponse` with proper 401 status

### 2. Added Comprehensive Error Handling

- Wrapped token refresh logic in try-catch blocks
- Added error handling around token exchange
- Added logging for debugging token type checking errors
- Graceful fallback when token operations fail

### 3. Improved Logging

- Added debug logging for token presence
- Added error logging for token operations
- Better error context for debugging

## Benefits

1. **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: Now returns 401 instead of 500
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when Redis operations fail
3. **Improved Debugging**: More detailed logging for troubleshooting
4. **User Experience**: Frontend receives proper 401 responses for re-authentication

## Expected Behavior Now

- **Valid tokens**: Request proceeds normally
- **Missing tokens**: Returns 401 with clear message
- **Redis errors**: Returns 401 instead of 500
- **Token validation errors**: Logs warning and continues processing

## Testing

After this fix, you should see:

1. **No more 500 errors** for authentication failures
2. **Proper 401 responses** when tokens are invalid/missing
3. **Better error messages** in the response body
4. **Improved logging** for debugging authentication issues

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the same underlying problem that was causing the Redis token service to appear to fail. The tokens are actually working correctly in Redis, but the error handling was causing 500 responses instead of the expected 401 responses.
