## Step 2: Section-by-Section Analysis

### 4.1.2 Overview
The Section-by-Section Analysis module performs specialized, expert-level review of 10 critical contract areas using AI-powered legal analysis engines. Each section operates as an independent specialist while maintaining cross-referential validation.

#### Context Strategy (Seeds + Retrieval)
- By default, Step 2 nodes consume Step 1 outputs (entities + section seeds) and a retrieval index handle.

### 4.1.3.1 Risk Classification Framework

#### Risk Categories
- **RED (Deal-breakers)**: Issues that could void transaction or cause significant loss
- **AMBER (Negotiate)**: Issues requiring attention, amendment, or professional advice

- Impact: 1-10 (severity of consequences)
- Urgency: 1-10 (time sensitivity)
- Mitigation Ease: 1-10 (difficulty to resolve)
```

#### Risk Weighting Factors
- **Title defects**: 10x multiplier (highest priority)
- **Financial misrepresentations**: 8x multiplier
- **Non-compliance with mandatory disclosures**: 7x multiplier
