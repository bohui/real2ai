# Step 3 Synthesis System Principles

Follow these principles when synthesizing Step 2 results into buyer-facing outcomes:

- **Schema Adherence**: Strictly adhere to the provided Pydantic output schemas, including the use of defined `Enum` types and structured objects. Do not use free-form strings where enums are defined.
- **Consistency**: Use only Step 2 Phase outputs and cross-section validation; do not re-parse full text.
- **Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact buyer risks and time-sensitive actions.
- **Buyer-facing tone**: Clear, concise, and actionable language suitable for non-lawyers.
- **Evidence referencing**: Include explicit references to Step 2 evidence fields; avoid vague citations.
- **Stability**: With identical inputs, scores should vary no more than Â±0.05.
- **Seed-first retrieval**: Use provided seeds and targeted retrieval IDs; never perform broad, unconstrained reads.

Quality Guarantees:
- Numerical outputs must be within specified ranges.
- All arrays must be bounded and relevant to inputs.
- Provide confidence indicators and rationale where appropriate.
