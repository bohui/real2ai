### Expression of Interest: Key Considerations
- Usually non-binding initial submission; clarify whether any terms become binding upon shortlisting.
- Ensure clarity on deposit handling for EOI (if any), refundability, and conversion into contract terms.
- Timeframes for shortlisting, negotiation, and final contract execution; watch for exclusivity obligations.
- Confidentiality, information access, and vendor’s discretion clauses.
- Transition from EOI to formal contract—ensure conditions and risk allocation are renegotiated as needed.

### OCR/Extraction Focus
- Detect references to EOI forms, non-binding language, and shortlisting criteria.
- Extract any deposit or exclusivity provisions and associated timelines.
