# Documentation Audit and Cleanup Summary

*Completed: August 2025*

## Overview

Completed comprehensive audit and cleanup of Real2.AI documentation, removing outdated transient files while preserving all essential documentation. The goal was to eliminate bug fix summaries, temporary implementation reports, and migration documents that are no longer relevant to current development.

9. **IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITY_TODO.md**
   - Reason: Outdated TODO list
   - Status: Tasks completed, preserved for historical context

10. **DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP.md**
    - Reason: Previous cleanup documentation
    - Status: Superseded by current audit

11. **design-specifications.md**
    - Reason: Phase 2 planning document, not current implementation
    - Status: Future planning document, preserved for reference
