### Off-the-Plan: Key Considerations
- Sunset dates and rights to extend, rescind, or terminate; check developer obligations and notice periods.
- Material change clauses (design/specification changes, lot reconfiguration, area variance) and purchaser rights.
- Deposit handling in trust, bank guarantee terms, and statutory limits.
- Disclosure requirements (plans, schedules, body corporate/strata details, warranties, cooling-off rules).
- Construction milestones, practical completion, defects liability periods, and settlement triggers (registration/occupancy certificate).
- Foreign investment and duty concessions where applicable; verify eligibility and timelines.

### OCR/Extraction Focus
- Extract sunset date, change clauses, staged payment schedule, disclosure documents referenced.
- Identify registration/plan numbers, lot/unit details, and milestone-based settlement triggers.
