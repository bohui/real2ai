### Standard Purchase: Key Considerations
- Typical conditions include finance approval, building/pest inspection, and general due diligence.
- Standard settlement periods (e.g., 30â€“90 days) unless otherwise agreed; confirm dates and time is of the essence.
- Deposit amount and staged payment timing should be clearly specified.
- Verify statutory disclosures and cooling-off applicability per state.
- Ensure adjustment mechanisms and inclusions/exclusions are clearly stated.

### OCR/Extraction Focus
- Extract condition clauses with deadlines, deposit terms, settlement period, and special conditions.
- Identify references to statutory disclosures and any waivers of rights.
