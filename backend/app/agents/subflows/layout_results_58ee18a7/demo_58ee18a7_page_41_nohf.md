10. Council and other public authority policies on hazard risk restrictions.

Is the land affected by a policy adopted by council, or by any other public authority required to be referred to in a planning certificate, that restricts the development of the land because of the likelihood of land slip, bushfire, tidal inundation, subsidence, contamination, acid sulphate soils or other risk (other than flooding)?

No.

Note: A review of Council's readily available records has been conducted to identify previous land uses that may have caused land contamination. This review did not reveal any reason for contamination of this property. However, prior to urban settlement, sizeable areas of Ku-ring-gai were covered by agricultural and horticultural activities. These uses are listed in the Managing Land Contamination Planning Guidelines as activities that may cause contamination. If you are concerned about possible contamination of the site you should make your own investigations regarding the condition of this property.

11. Bush fire prone land

Is the land bush fire prone land?

No.

**SPECIAL NOTE:** Bush fire prone land is defined in section 4 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 as meaning "land recorded for the time being as bushfire prone land on a bush fire prone land map for the area". The "area" is the local government area of Ku-ring-gai.

12. Loose-fill asbestos insulation

Does the land include any residential premises (within the meaning of Division 1A of Part 8 of the Home Building Act 1989) that are listed on the register that is required to be maintained under that Division?

NSW Fair Trading has not provided Council with written confirmation that this property is
listed on the Loose-Fill Asbestos Insulation Register.

**SPECIAL NOTE:** Some residential homes located in the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area have been identified as containing loose-fill asbestos insulation, for example in the roof space. NSW Fair Trading maintains a Register of homes that are affected by loose-fill asbestos insulation.

You should make your own enquiries as to the age of the buildings on the land to which this certificate relates and, if it contains a building constructed prior to 1980, the council strongly recommends that any potential purchaser obtain advice from a licensed asbestos assessor to determine whether loose-fill asbestos is present in any building on the land and, if so, the health risks (if any) this may pose for the building's occupants.
