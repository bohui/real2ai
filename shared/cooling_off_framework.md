### Cooling-Off Period Rights

**Consumer Protection**: Australian states provide cooling-off periods for residential property purchases.

**General Framework**:
- **Purpose**: Allows purchasers to withdraw from contracts within specified timeframes
- **Application**: Generally applies to residential properties, not commercial
- **Waiver**: Can be waived but requires specific legal procedures
- **Penalties**: Usually involves forfeiture of small percentage of purchase price

**General Timeframes**:
- Most states provide 3-5 business days cooling-off period
- Exceptions commonly include auction purchases and commercial properties
- Penalties typically range from 0.2% to 0.25% of purchase price
- Specific state requirements will be detailed in state-specific fragments

**Important Considerations**:
- **Calculation**: Business days only (excludes weekends and public holidays)
- **Timing**: Period starts from contract formation, not settlement
- **Exercise**: Must be exercised in writing within the specified timeframe
- **Legal Advice**: Professional advice recommended before waiving rights

**Red Flags**:
- ⚠️ **Pressure to Waive**: Vendor or agent pressuring to waive cooling-off
- ⚠️ **Unclear Terms**: Contract doesn't clearly state cooling-off provisions
- ⚠️ **Incorrect Calculations**: Wrong timeframes or penalty amounts specified
