### Victoria Cooling-Off Period Provisions

**VIC Standard Period**: 3 clear business days after the purchaser signs the contract of sale

**Key Victoria Features**:
- **Timeframe**: 3 clear business days (excludes weekends and Victorian public holidays)
- **Start point**: From the date the purchaser signs (not when the vendor signs)
- **Penalty on rescission**: Vendor may retain the greater of $100 or 0.2% of the purchase price from monies paid
- **How to exercise**: Written notice of rescission to the vendor or the vendor’s estate agent within the period

**VIC Exceptions (No Cooling-Off)**:
- Purchased at a publicly advertised auction, or contract signed on the auction day
- Contract signed within 3 clear business days before or after a publicly advertised auction for that property
- Property used mainly for industrial or commercial purposes
- Property more than 20 hectares and used mainly for farming
- Purchaser is a corporate body
- Purchaser is an estate agent or a related party of an estate agent
- Purchaser has previously signed a contract for the same property with the same vendor on substantially the same terms

**VIC Waiver/Variation**:
- No solicitor’s certificate mechanism (unlike NSW). If an exception applies, no cooling‑off right arises; otherwise the statutory right applies and cannot be waived by certificate

**Important Victoria Notes**:
- “Clear business days” excludes weekends and Victorian public holidays
- Applies to private sales of residential and small rural property only
- Separate from contractual finance/special conditions and from remedies for defective Section 32 disclosures
