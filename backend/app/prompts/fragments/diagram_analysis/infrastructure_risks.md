### Infrastructure Risk Assessment Framework

**Critical Infrastructure Risks:**
- **Sewer Mains Under Building Areas**: Major sewer lines running directly under proposed or existing building footprints
- **High Voltage Power Lines**: Overhead or underground power lines with safety clearance requirements
- **Gas Main Proximity**: High-pressure gas lines requiring development setbacks and safety zones
- **Shared Infrastructure Failures**: Single points of failure affecting multiple properties
- **Inadequate Service Capacity**: Existing infrastructure unable to support intended property use

**High Risk Infrastructure Issues:**
- **Utility Easement Conflicts**: Building envelope restrictions from utility easements and access requirements
- **Maintenance Access Requirements**: Council or utility company access obligations affecting property use
- **Shared Service Arrangements**: Complex arrangements with maintenance and upgrade obligations
- **Infrastructure Upgrade Requirements**: Property development triggering mandatory infrastructure upgrades
- **Service Connection Inadequacies**: Insufficient connection capacity for intended property use

**Medium Risk Infrastructure Considerations:**
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Older utility systems approaching end-of-life requiring replacement
- **Utility Line Depth Issues**: Shallow utility lines affecting foundation design and landscaping
- **Telecommunications Inadequacy**: Insufficient broadband or mobile coverage affecting property value
- **Stormwater Management**: Inadequate drainage systems affecting property flooding risk
- **Service Meter Locations**: Awkward or inaccessible utility meter placements

**Assessment Criteria for Infrastructure Elements:**
- **Location Impact**: Proximity to building areas and property development zones
- **Access Requirements**: Utility company or council maintenance access obligations
- **Development Restrictions**: Constraints on building design and property improvements
- **Safety Clearances**: Required distances from infrastructure for safety compliance
- **Upgrade Obligations**: Potential requirements to upgrade or relocate infrastructure
- **Shared Arrangements**: Complexity of shared infrastructure and cost-sharing agreements

**Professional Consultation Triggers:**
- **Structural Engineer**: Foundation design around major infrastructure, soil stability assessment
- **Utility Coordination**: Complex service connections or upgrade requirements
- **Council Liaison**: Infrastructure approval processes and compliance requirements
- **Geotechnical Assessment**: Soil conditions affecting infrastructure placement and stability
