### Environmental Risk Assessment Framework

**Critical Environmental Risks:**
- **High Flood Risk Zones**: Properties in defined flood areas with regular inundation risk
- **Extreme Bushfire Attack Levels**: BAL-FZ (Flame Zone) or BAL-40 requiring special construction standards
- **Slope Instability**: Steep slopes with erosion or landslide potential affecting structural integrity
- **Contaminated Land**: Known or suspected contamination requiring remediation before occupation
- **Major Drainage Issues**: Poor drainage causing regular flooding or water damage

**High Risk Environmental Factors:**
- **Moderate Flood Zones**: 1:100 year flood areas affecting insurance and building requirements
- **High Bushfire Risk Areas**: BAL-19 or BAL-29 requiring construction upgrades and defendable space
- **Coastal Erosion Zones**: Properties subject to coastal processes and sea level rise impacts
- **Wetland Boundaries**: Development restrictions from environmental protection requirements
- **Acid Sulfate Soils**: Soil disturbance restrictions and management plan requirements

**Medium Risk Environmental Considerations:**
- **Low-Medium Flood Risk**: Potential flooding requiring insurance consideration and drainage planning
- **Moderate Bushfire Risk**: BAL-12.5 or vegetation proximity requiring basic fire safety measures
- **Slope Drainage**: Moderate slopes requiring adequate drainage and retention systems
- **Heritage Tree Protection**: Significant vegetation requiring protection during development
- **Noise Pollution Sources**: Traffic, industrial, or commercial noise affecting property amenity

**Environmental Assessment Criteria:**
- **Risk Level Classification**: Official government mapping and risk zone classifications
- **Insurance Implications**: Impact on building and contents insurance availability and cost
- **Building Requirements**: Special construction standards and compliance obligations
- **Development Restrictions**: Limitations on property improvements and land use changes
- **Mitigation Costs**: Expenses for risk reduction measures and protective systems
- **Long-term Viability**: Ongoing exposure to environmental risks and climate change impacts

**State-Specific Environmental Considerations:**
- **NSW**: Section 10.7 certificates, BASIX requirements, coastal hazard mapping
- **VIC**: Planning scheme overlays, ResCode compliance, native vegetation protection
- **QLD**: State Planning Policy compliance, koala habitat mapping, coastal management plans

**Professional Consultation Requirements:**
- **Environmental Consultant**: Contamination assessment, flood/bushfire risk evaluation
- **Geotechnical Engineer**: Soil stability assessment, slope engineering, foundation requirements
- **Ecologist**: Native vegetation assessment, habitat protection requirements
- **Planning Consultant**: Environmental overlay compliance, development approval processes
