2.2 Normally, the purchaser must pay the deposit on the making of this contract, and this time is essential.

2.3 If this contract requires the purchaser to pay any of the deposit by a later time, that time is also essential.

2.4 The purchaser can pay any of the deposit by –

2.4.1 giving cash (up to $2,000) to the depositholder;

2.4.2 unconditionally giving a cheque to the depositholder or to the vendor, vendor's agent or vendor's solicitor for sending to the depositholder; or

2.4.3 electronic funds transfer to the depositholder's nominated account and, if requested by the vendor or the depositholder, providing evidence of that transfer.

2.5 The vendor can terminate if –

2.5.1 any of the deposit is not paid on time;

2.5.2 a cheque for any of the deposit is not honoured on presentation; or

2.5.3 a payment under clause 2.4.3 is not received in the depositholder's nominated account by 5.00 pm on the third business day after the time for payment.

This right to terminate is lost as soon as the deposit is paid in full.

2.6 If the vendor accepts a deposit-bond for the deposit, clauses 2.1 to 2.5 do not apply.

2.7 If the vendor accepts a deposit-bond for part of the deposit, clauses 2.1 to 2.5 apply only to the balance.

2.8 If any of the deposit or of the balance of the price is paid before completion to the vendor or as the vendor directs, it is a charge on the land in favour of the purchaser until termination by the vendor or completion, subject to any existing right.

2.9 If each party tells the depositholder that the deposit is to be invested, the depositholder is to invest the deposit (at the risk of the party who becomes entitled to it) with a bank, in an interest-bearing account in NSW, payable at call, with interest to be reinvested, and pay the interest to the parties equally, after deduction of all proper government taxes and financial institution charges and other charges.

## 3 Deposit-bond

3.1 This clause applies only if the vendor accepts a deposit-bond for the deposit (or part of it).

3.2 The purchaser must provide the deposit-bond to the vendor's solicitor (or if no solicitor the depositholder) at or before the making of this contract and this time is essential.

3.3 If the deposit-bond has an expiry date and completion does not occur by the date which is 14 days before the expiry date, the purchaser must serve a replacement deposit-bond at least 7 days before the expiry date. The time for service is essential.

3.4 The vendor must approve a replacement deposit-bond if –

3.4.1 it is from the same issuer and for the same amount as the earlier deposit-bond; and

3.4.2 it has an expiry date at least three months after its date of issue.

3.5 A breach of clauses 3.2 or 3.3 entitles the vendor to terminate. The right to terminate is lost as soon as –

3.5.1 the purchaser serves a replacement deposit-bond; or

3.5.2 the deposit is paid in full under clause 2.
