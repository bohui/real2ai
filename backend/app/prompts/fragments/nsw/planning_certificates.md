### NSW Section 149 Planning Certificates

**Critical NSW Requirement**: Section 149 planning certificates must be provided under NSW Conveyancing Act.

**Key Information to Verify**:
- **Zoning Classification**: Residential, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use designation
- **Development Restrictions**: Height limits, floor space ratios, building setbacks
- **Heritage Listings**: Any heritage conservation areas or individual listings
- **Environmental Constraints**: Flood zones, contaminated land, acid sulfate soils
- **Infrastructure Contributions**: Section 7.11 or 7.12 development contributions
- **Future Development**: Planned road widening, rezoning proposals, or infrastructure projects

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent Zoning**: Certificate doesn't match current land use
- ⚠️ **Pending Rezoning**: Applications that could affect property value
- ⚠️ **Infrastructure Impacts**: Road widening that could affect property boundaries
- ⚠️ **Environmental Issues**: Contamination or flood risk not previously disclosed

**Compliance Notes**:
- Certificate must be current (issued within 6 months for most purposes)
- Multiple certificates may be required for large or complex properties
- Additional specialist reports may be needed based on certificate findings
