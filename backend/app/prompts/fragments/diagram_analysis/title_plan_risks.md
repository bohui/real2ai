### Title Plan Specific Risk Assessment

**Critical Title Plan Risks:**
- **Easement Burdening Property**: Registered easements significantly restricting property use or development potential
- **Right of Way Dependencies**: Property access relying on easements over other properties with potential access disputes
- **Crown Land Boundaries**: Properties adjacent to Crown land with uncertain boundary treatments
- **Unregistered Interests**: Potential unregistered easements or interests not shown on title plan

**High Risk Title Plan Issues:**
- **Easement in Gross**: Easements benefiting public authorities with broad interpretation powers
- **Pipeline Easements**: High-pressure gas or petroleum pipelines with safety restrictions and development limitations
- **Drainage Easements**: Natural or constructed drainage lines affecting building placement and landscaping
- **Transmission Line Easements**: Electrical transmission easements with electromagnetic field and safety concerns

**Title Plan Assessment Criteria:**
- **Easement Width and Location**: Physical dimensions and property impact assessment
- **Beneficiary Rights**: Scope of easement holder rights and property owner obligations
- **Maintenance Responsibilities**: Cost and responsibility allocation for easement area upkeep
- **Development Restrictions**: Building and improvement limitations within easement areas
- **Access Rights**: Vehicle and pedestrian access provisions and restrictions

**Boundary and Survey Risks:**
- **Old Survey Methods**: Historical surveys with lower accuracy requiring modern verification
- **Boundary Marking Absence**: Lack of physical boundary markers requiring professional survey
- **Coordinate System Discrepancies**: Different coordinate systems between old and new surveys
- **Natural Boundary Changes**: Water boundaries subject to erosion or accretion changes

**Legal Title Risks:**
- **Duplicate Certificate of Title**: Risk of fraudulent dealings with duplicate titles
- **Caveat Limitations**: Caveats preventing registration of dealings or creating title uncertainty
- **Restrictive Covenants**: Use restrictions affecting property development or modification
- **Plan Amendment Requirements**: Title plan errors requiring costly amendment procedures

**Professional Consultation for Title Issues:**
- **Licensed Surveyor**: Boundary verification, easement location survey, coordinate system reconciliation
- **Property Lawyer**: Easement interpretation, title risk assessment, caveat resolution
- **Title Insurance Specialist**: Coverage for title defects and boundary disputes
- **Planning Consultant**: Development impact assessment for easements and restrictions
