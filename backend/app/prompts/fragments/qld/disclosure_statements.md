### Queensland Form 1 Disclosure Statements

**Critical QLD Requirement**: Form 1 disclosure statements must be provided under Property Law Act 1974.

**Key Information to Verify**:
- **Property Description**: Legal description, lot and plan numbers, registered interests
- **Title Information**: Current certificate of title, registered encumbrances, caveats
- **Planning and Zoning**: Current zoning, planning scheme provisions, development approvals
- **Infrastructure**: Connection to water, sewerage, electricity, gas, telecommunications
- **Body Corporate**: Community titles scheme details, fees, levies, by-laws
- **Rates and Charges**: Council rates, water charges, current amounts and payment status

**Mandatory Disclosures**:
- **Building Approvals**: All building work approvals and certificates
- **Planning Permits**: Development applications and approvals
- **Environmental Issues**: Contamination, environmental protection orders
- **Flooding**: Known flood events, flood mapping information
- **Notices**: Any government or council notices affecting the property
- **Access Rights**: Easements, rights of way, access arrangements

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- ⚠️ **Incomplete Form 1**: Missing mandatory sections or supporting documents
- ⚠️ **Outstanding Body Corporate Levies**: Unpaid fees or special assessments
- ⚠️ **Planning Compliance Issues**: Unauthorised building work or non-compliant structures  
- ⚠️ **Environmental Concerns**: Contamination reports or environmental restrictions
- ⚠️ **Flood Risk**: Property in flood-prone areas without adequate disclosure

**Queensland Compliance Notes**:
- Form 1 must be current and complete at contract signing
- Additional reports may be referenced and should be obtained
- Body corporate records must include financial statements and meeting minutes
- Environmental searches increasingly important for industrial/commercial areas
