### NSW Cooling-Off Period Provisions

**NSW Standard Period**: 5 business days from contract exchange (ends 5:00pm on the 5th business day)

**Key NSW Features**:
- **Timeframe**: 5 business days (excludes weekends and public holidays)
- **Start Date**: From exchange of contracts (both parties sign)
- **Penalty**: Buyer forfeits 0.25% of the purchase price if rescinding during the period
- **Exercise Method**: Written notice of rescission delivered to the vendor or agent within the period

**Off-the-Plan Purchases**:
- A 10 business day cooling‑off period applies to off‑the‑plan contracts

**NSW Exceptions (No Cooling-Off)**:
- Properties sold at auction
- If contracts are exchanged on the same day as an auction after the property is passed in
- Commercial and industrial property transactions

**NSW Waiver/Variation**:
- Cooling‑off can be waived by a purchaser’s solicitor/conveyancer issuing a Section 66W certificate under the Conveyancing Act 1919
- The period may be shortened or extended by written agreement between the parties

**Important NSW Notes**:
- Public holidays in NSW affect calculation of business days
- Agents must not provide legal advice about waiving cooling‑off; independent legal advice is recommended
- Rescission under cooling‑off does not extinguish other contractual obligations already accrued (aside from the 0.25% forfeiture)
