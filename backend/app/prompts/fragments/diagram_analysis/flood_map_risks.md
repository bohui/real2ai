### Flood Map Specific Risk Assessment

**Critical Flood-Specific Risks:**
- **High Hazard Flood Zone**: Properties in H1-H6 high hazard areas with life safety risks and development prohibitions
- **Flood Planning Level Exceedance**: Floor levels below Flood Planning Level requiring expensive raising or flood-proofing
- **Mainstream Flooding Risk**: Properties adjacent to major watercourses with severe flood potential
- **Flash Flood Pathways**: Properties in natural flow paths with rapid onset flooding risks

**High Risk Flood Considerations:**
- **Medium Hazard Flood Areas**: H7-H10 areas requiring flood impact assessments and building modifications
- **Frequent Flooding (1:10 to 1:20 year)**: Regular nuisance flooding affecting property access and amenity
- **Evacuation Route Dependencies**: Properties requiring evacuation through flood-prone areas
- **Flood Emergency Response Limitations**: Areas with poor emergency service access during flood events

**Flood Map Assessment Criteria:**
- **Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP)**: 1% AEP (1:100 year) flood levels and building requirements
- **Hazard Categories**: H1-H6 (high hazard) vs H7-H10 (medium hazard) development controls
- **Flood Planning Level**: Required floor levels above defined flood level (typically 1% AEP + 500mm)
- **Hydraulic Categories**: Floodway, flood storage, flood fringe development controls
- **Climate Change Projections**: Future flood level increases affecting long-term viability

**Insurance and Financial Implications:**
- **Flood Insurance Availability**: Standard building insurance exclusions for flood damage
- **Premium Loading**: Significant insurance cost increases for flood-prone properties
- **Loan Security Issues**: Lender reluctance for properties with high flood risk
- **Resale Value Impact**: Market value reduction due to flood risk disclosure requirements

**Professional Consultation for Flood Risk:**
- **Hydraulic Engineer**: Flood impact assessment, building level requirements, flood-proofing design
- **Insurance Broker**: Flood insurance availability and cost assessment
- **Emergency Management Consultant**: Evacuation planning and flood response procedures
- **Building Surveyor**: Flood-resistant construction methods and compliance requirements
