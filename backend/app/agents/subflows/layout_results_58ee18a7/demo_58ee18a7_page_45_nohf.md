THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS ISSUED UNDER SECTION 10.7(5)
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT ACT 1979

Land Slip or Subsidence:

Council records do not have sufficient information to indicate land slip or subsidence is likely to restrict development on this land. However, some lots in Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area contain filling and/or road batters which may be subject to settlement and require special consideration in the design of foundations.

Flooding:

The Middle Harbour South Flood Study which was adopted by Council on 13/12/2022 has identified this property to be located between the Flood Planning Level and the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) on the PMF flood extent map.

Please note: The flood study reports or flood certificate report will provide further detail about the location, extent and nature of flooding on the lot.

For further information please see <https://www.krg.nsw.gov.au/floodrisk>

**SPECIAL NOTE:** The Department of Planning and Environment and the Department of Commerce have not indicated any private property which may be affected by flooding of major rivers or creeks in the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area.

Loose-fill asbestos insulation:

Some residential homes located in the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area have been identified as containing loose-fill asbestos insulation, for example in the roof space. NSW Fair Trading maintains a Register of homes that are affected by loose-fill asbestos insulation.

You should make your own enquiries as to the age of the buildings on the land to which this certificate relates and, if it contains a building constructed prior to 1980, the council strongly recommends that any potential purchaser obtain advice from a licensed asbestos assessor to determine whether loose-fill asbestos is present in any building on the land and, if so, the health risks (if any) this may pose for the building's occupants.

For further information about the Loos-fill asbestos Public Register please contact NSW Fair Trading. Tel:13 32 20 or www.loosefillasbestos.nsw.gov.au.

Contamination:

Council records do not have sufficient information relating to any previous uses of this land to confirm that the land has not been used for a purpose which would be likely to have contaminated the land. Parties should make their own enquiries as to whether the land may be contaminated.
