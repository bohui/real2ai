### Private Treaty: Key Considerations
- Negotiable conditions (finance approval, building/pest inspections, due diligence) should be explicit with clear deadlines.
- Cooling-off may apply depending on state and circumstances; validate statutory periods and exclusions.
- Offer and acceptance sequence should be documented; beware of counter-offer resets to terms/timeframes.
- Deposit structure (initial holding vs balance) and timing should be specified.
- Monitor sunset/expiry clauses on offers and conditional approvals.
- Ensure clarity on inclusions/exclusions, fixtures, special conditions, and adjustments.

### OCR/Extraction Focus
- Extract finance approval deadline, inspection dates, and any other conditional clauses.
- Capture offer validity/expiry, counter-offer notes, and acceptance dates.
- Identify deposit amount/percentage and required payment timing.
- Detect cooling-off references, waiver notices, or penalty clauses.
