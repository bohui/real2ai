WARNINGS

1. Various Acts of Parliament and other matters can affect the rights of the parties to this contract. Some important matters are actions, claims, decisions, licences, notices, orders, proposals or rights of way involving:

APA Group NSW Department of Education

Australian Taxation Office NSW Fair Trading

Council Owner of adjoining land

County Council Privacy

Department of Planning and Environment Public Works Advisory

Department of Primary Industries Subsidence Advisory NSW

Electricity and gas Telecommunications

Land and Housing Corporation Transport for NSW

Local Land Services Water, sewerage or drainage authority

If you think that any of these matters affects the property, tell your solicitor.

2. A lease may be affected by the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1990, the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 or the Retail Leases Act 1994.

3. If any purchase money is owing to the Crown, it will become payable before obtaining consent, or if no consent is needed, when the transfer is registered.

4. If a consent to transfer is required under legislation, see clause 27 as to the obligations of the parties.

5. The vendor should continue the vendor's insurance until completion. If the vendor wants to give the purchaser possession before completion, the vendor should first ask the insurer to confirm this will not affect the insurance.

6. Most purchasers will have to pay transfer duty (and, sometimes, if the purchaser is not an Australian citizen, surcharge purchaser duty) on this contract. Some purchasers may be eligible to choose to pay first home buyer choice property tax instead of transfer duty. If a payment is not made on time, interest and penalties may be incurred.

7. If the purchaser agrees to the release of deposit, the purchaser's right to recover the deposit may stand behind the rights of others (for example the vendor's mortgagee).

8. The purchaser should arrange insurance as appropriate.

9. Some transactions involving personal property may be affected by the Personal Property Securities Act 2009.

10. A purchaser should be satisfied that finance will be available at the time of completing the purchase.

11. Where the market value of the property is at or above a legislated amount, the purchaser may have to comply with a foreign resident capital gains withholding payment obligation (even if the vendor is not a foreign resident). If so, this will affect the amount available to the vendor on completion.

12. Purchasers of some residential properties may have to withhold part of the purchase price to be credited towards the GST liability of the vendor. If so, this will also affect the amount available to the vendor. More information is available from the ATO.
